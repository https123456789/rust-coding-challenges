# Rust Coding Challenges

This is a collection of my solutions to various coding challenges in Rust.

The main purpose behind me completing these challenges is to facilitate me learning Rust and various CS concepts.

## Credit

I try to write as much of the code from scratch, but in some cases, it is not worth the envestment of time to learn how to accomplish some of the things required to complete the challenge.
